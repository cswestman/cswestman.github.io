						<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
						<p>Born and raised in Southern Florida, I eventually moved to North Georgia, graduating high school at Ringgold High, just South of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Upon graduation, I joined the Army. I served for eight years, ended my term, then served as an Operations Manager at an electrical supply warehouse. During this last year, I have spent most of my down time reading books, learning coding languages, and building interesting technologies. This entire journey, rather brief, has led me to gain a lot of useful and exciting skills.</p>

						<h3 id="web">Web Design and Development Skills</h3>
						<h4>Let me get right to the point! Throughout this learning and development process, I must say, I’ve come to the realization that I absolutely love this technology and the power behind it. Listed below, are the skills I’ve attained over the last couple of years.</h4>
						<p>Development using coding languages such as CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, and even a hint of PHP, C#, and Java</p>
						<p>Using the jQuery library to help streamline development workflows by simplifying code </p>
						<p>Building responsive web content built on UI and UX principles, reacting and changing based on screen size and orientation</p>
						<p>Using <em>mobile first</em> approaches when creating content primarily being viewed on mobile devices</p>
						<p>Designing content based on graphic design principles and theories, and using Adobe InDesign and Photoshop to help generate design concepts </p>
						<p>Creating/editing images and icons using Adobe Creative programs, such as Photoshop and Illustrator </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 id="management">Project and Operational Management Skills</h3>
						<h4>Throughout my time in the Army, and while also serving as an Operations Manager in my civilian life, I have gained many great skills that allow me to bring teams together, streamline operational needs, and complete projects on time. I did this all using the following:</h4>
						<p>Managing logistical supply needs of warehouse and offices</p>
						<p>Coordinating incoming and outgoing freight</p>
						<p>Managing sales and marketing strategies</p>
						<p>Refining operational processes through careful process analysis and feedback loops</p>
						<p>Managing projects using SCRUM principles</p>
						<p>Maintaining team morale through event planning and weekly counseling and feedback</p>
						<p>Cross training team members</p>
						</li>
					<li>
						<h3 id="training">Training and Instructional Skills</h3>
						<h4>A large portion of my Army service was spent training Soldiers.  I did this through small unit training while serving as a Squad Leader and Platoon Sergeant at various units. Additionally, I did this on an official level, as a certified Army instructor. When serving at Fort Benning, I was a full-time instructor teaching and certifying Soldiers. I taught Pathfinder, Air Assault, and Rappel Master courses. To accomplish everything talked about, I used the following skills:</h4>
						<p>Adaptive teaching techniques to cater towards multiple learning styles</p>
						<p>Coordinate and request all instruction supply needs</p>
						<p>Plan and update course scope and execution methods based on updated course standards and regulations</p>
						<p>Train subordinate leadership on the fundamentals of effective teaching</p>
						<p>Use course critique feedback loops to improve and refine course material and execution</p>
						<p>Prepare and rehearse instruction</p>
						<p>Confident public speaking</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 id="awards">Awards and Certifications</h3>
						<h4>I don’t often feel it necessary to list such items. I have met many people that have more credentials than I do, but you couldn’t pay me all the money in the world to put them in charge of something. I believe in letting one’s actions speak for their ability to be an effective leader and mentor. Nonetheless, this is a comprehensive list of the courses I have completed and some awards.</h4>
